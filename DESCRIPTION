Description: This function obtains a Random Number Generator (RNG) or collection of RNGs that replicate the required parameter(s) of a distribution for a time series of data. Consider the case of reproducing a time series data set of size 20 that uses an autoregressive (AR) model with phi = 0.8 and standard deviation equal to 1. When one checks the arima.sin() function's estimated parameters, it's possible that after a single trial or a few more, one won't find the precise parameters. This enables one to look for the ideal RNG setting for a simulation that will accurately duplicate the desired parameters.
